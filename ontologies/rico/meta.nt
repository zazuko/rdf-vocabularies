As the third part of Records in Contexts standard, it is a formal\n               representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM). This version, which\n               is v1.1, is the latest official release. It is compliant with RiC-CM v1.0.</html:p>\n            <html:p>The following diagram shows the main RiC-CM 1.0 entities and a few relations\n               between them: <html:img src=\"https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/blob/7bc6d5d59ecc85a4b901cc79d649ae50209fd69e/diagrams/diagrams_v1-0/RiC-CM-overview/diagram_RiC-CM-overview-RiC-v1-0.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"A partial overview of RiC-CM 1.0 main entities\" class=\"diagram\"></html:img>\n            </html:p>\n            <html:div id=\"design-principles\">\n               <html:h4>RiC-O design principles</html:h4>\n               <html:p>The following design principles were followed when developing RiC-O.</html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>1. RiC-O is a domain and reference ontology</html:strong>.</html:p>\n               <html:p>RiC-O provides <html:strong>a generic vocabulary and formal rules for\n                     creating RDF datasets (or generating them from existing archival metadata) that\n                     describe in a consistent way any kind of archival record\n                  resource</html:strong>. It supports publishing RDF datasets as Linked Data,\n                  querying them using SPARQL, and making inferences using the logic of the\n                  ontology.</html:p>\n               <html:p>While some projects have built some specific ontologies for describing\n                  archives, in 2013 no generic domain ontology existed for the specific needs of the\n                  archival community. This is why EGAD decided to develop RiC-O as a part of RiC\n                  standard.</html:p>\n               <html:p>Apart from this first, main target, <html:strong>RiC-O, as a technical\n                     implementation of RiC-CM that also extends and refines it and that includes\n                     formal logic, can guide or inspire, in many ways, the development of any tool\n                     or system that manages (i.e. stores, enables to edit or processes) and\n                     publishes descriptive archival metadata.</html:strong>. Of course, other\n                  technical implementations of RiC-CM may be developed later on. Also, the current\n                  technical implementations of the former ICA standards, e.g. EAD and EAC-CPF XML\n                  schemas, should be made closer to RiC-CM in the future; on this topic, see <html:a href=\"https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-encoded-archival-standards-ts-eas\">the news and announcements of the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival\n                     Standards (TS-EAS) of the Society of American Archivists</html:a>.</html:p>\n               <html:p>As RiC-O is a generic, domain ontology, <html:strong>it does not address by\n                     itself every specific need or expectation</html:strong> that may occur in every\n                  archival institution or project. It is rather <html:strong>a high level\n                     framework</html:strong> and an institution or project implementing RiC-O can\n                  apply only such a subset of properties as meets their needs, or extend the\n                  specification according to their particular requirements, or do both.</html:p>\n               <html:p>As a domain ontology, RiC-O, at this stage, does not borrow from other\n                  existing ontologies (such as the cultural heritage models – IFLA-LRM and\n                  CIDOC-CRM, PREMIS, or PROV-O). It should therefore be easier, for an archival\n                  institution or archival project, to understand, implement and maintain RiC-O\n                  within its system.</html:p>\n               <html:p>Alignment with those and other models, where possible, will be undertaken in\n                  a future revision cycle to support the interconnected nature of resource\n                  description across the domains. This is of course essential for interconnecting\n                  RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O with other datasets, or for using parts of RiC-O\n                  in other contexts than the archival or records management realm.</html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>2. RiC-O is immediately usable.</html:strong>\n               </html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>This is a key feature</html:strong>. <html:strong>Metadata conforming\n                     to superseded ICA standards can be transformed to RiC-O\n                     successfully</html:strong>. Converting existing archival metadata created or\n                  generated in current information systems and compliant with ICA standards to\n                  RDF/RiC-O is possible without losing data or structure.</html:p>\n               <html:p>During the ongoing development process of RiC-O, intensive conversion\n                  testing, either by hand or using scripts, was conducted on XML/EAD finding aids\n                  and XML/EAC-CPF authority records to ensure that RiC-O is usable with existing\n                  descriptive metadata. An <html:a href=\"https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter\">open source\n                     conversion software</html:a> was also developed, whose first version was\n                  published in April 2020.</html:p>\n               <html:p>While some existing metadata sets may have a very fine level of granularity\n                  and accuracy, already using, for example, controlled vocabularies, or describing\n                  curation events separately, often these metadata don’t have the very precise\n                  structure that RiC-CM recommends. Even then, such a conversion process remains\n                  possible. In order to allow this, RiC-O sometimes provides several methods for\n                  representing information (as described below). From this point of view, RiC-O 1.1\n                  may be considered a transitional ontology, in which some components may be\n                  deprecated later on.</html:p>\n               <html:p>The usability of a model also depends on its documentation. RiC-O is\n                  documented extensively. The documentation will be reviewed and updated on a\n                  continuing basis.</html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>3. RiC-O provides a flexible framework</html:strong>.</html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>This is a very important principle too</html:strong>. It is related\n                  with the usability principle quoted above. Moreover, <html:strong>archival\n                     description is flexible by essence</html:strong>. It is quite commonly noted\n                  that today the level of granularity of information varies from one finding aid to\n                  another (or from one authority record to another), or even within the same finding\n                  aid. Some series or agents are described summarily because little is known about\n                  them and there is little time for extensive research, while other series, even\n                  records, or agents are described in detail; some relations (e.g. that relating to\n                  provenance) may be described without any detail while others may be thoroughly\n                  documented, as ISAAR(CPF) and EAC-CPF allow it.</html:p>\n               <html:p>Being generally flexible, for an OWL ontology, depends first on the\n                  polyhierarchical systems of classes and properties it provides. A superproperty or\n                  superclass, more general or generic than its subproperties or subclasses, must\n                  exist and be available for handling information, while at the same time more\n                  accurate subcomponents must be there for handling more accurate description. Also,\n                  RiC-O provides methods for describing relations as full entities, as well as\n                  direct and short paths between entities.</html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>4. RiC-O opens new potential for archival description.</html:strong>\n               </html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>Linked Data tools and interfaces enable end users to go through\n                     RDF/RiC-O graphs, query them using SPARQL, and make inferences. This means a\n                     completely new way of consulting archival metadata and their multiple\n                     contexts.</html:strong> An end user should be able to ask of any given data\n                  set, for example, “What are (according to your dataset) the corporate bodies that\n                  succeeded a given entity from its end of existence to now (as concerns this given\n                  activity)?”, or “what instantiations of this photograph exist?”, or “what are the\n                  existing copies of this original charter?”, and get a list of these entities. This\n                  means that institutions or projects that invest in the implementation of RiC-O\n                  will be able to query their data in ways not possible with the previous ICA\n                  standards, and will get new insight into the content and context of their archives\n                  that wasn’t visible with the existing ICA-standards. What is more, repositories\n                  using RiC-O may infer new assertions from the RDF datasets and link them to other\n                  resources outside their institution, thereby amplifying the query and inferencing\n                  possibilities manifold.</html:p>\n               <html:p>\n                  <html:strong>5. RiC-O is extensible.</html:strong>\n               </html:p>\n               <html:p>Institutions with descriptive needs beyond what RiC-O provides out-of-the-box\n                  have the option of extending the ontology by adding new subclasses or\n                  subproperties as needed. Also, the concepts defined in existing SKOS vocabularies\n                  (e.g. a list of documentary form types) can also be connected to RiC-O based\n                  graphs (using the *Type classes, and properties which are in the domain or range\n                  of these classes).</html:p>\n               <html:p>RiC-O has also the potential to be usable in other contexts than purely\n                  archival ones. It can be used to “hook” archival description to descriptive\n                  metadata in other domains (e.g. bibliographic or museum metadata). As said above,\n                  alignment with other models will be undertaken by EGAD in a future revision cycle,\n                  facilitating such connections.</html:p>\n            </html:div>\n            <html:div id=\"understanding-RiCO\">\n               <html:h4>Understanding RiC-O: a quick overview of some features</html:h4>\n               <html:div id=\"fromRiCCM-to-RiCO\">\n                  <html:h5>From RiC-CM to RiC-O</html:h5>\n                  <html:div id=\"From_RiC-CM_components_to_RiC-O_classes\">\n                     <html:h6>1. From RiC-CM components to RiC-O classes</html:h6>\n                     <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>Each RiC-CM entity has a corresponding class in\n                           RiC-O</html:strong>. These classes are organized according to the same\n                        hierarchy as in RiC-CM. Some projects may need very few of them (e.g. Agent,\n                        Record Resource and Activity only), while others may need more (e.g.\n                        Corporate Body and Person; Record; Place).</html:p>\n                     <html:p>\n                        <html:strong>Many classes only exist in RiC-O and not in\n                           RiC-CM</html:strong>. These additional classes address special\n                        needs:</html:p>\n                     <html:ul>\n                        <html:li>\n                           <html:strong>some correspond to RiC-CM attributes</html:strong>, when it\n                           may be considered necessary to handle them as full entities. This is the\n                           case for <html:a href=\"#rico:Type\">Type</html:a> and its subclasses, that\n                           correspond to RiC-CM attributes that contain controlled values, and that\n                           can help to articulate RiC-O with external RDF resources like SKOS\n                           vocabularies; and also for <html:a href=\"#rico:Language\">Language</html:a>, <html:a href=\"#rico:Name\">Name</html:a> and\n                              <html:a href=\"#rico:Identifier\">Identifier</html:a>, that can be\n                           considered as full entities and as key linking nodes in a RDF graph. All\n                           these classes have been grouped under a <html:a href=\"#rico:Concept\">Concept</html:a> class.</html:li>\n                        <html:li>\n                           <html:strong>some classes have been added in order to provide a more\n                              accurate definition and model for some entities</html:strong>. For\n                           example, <html:a href=\"#rico:Place\">Place</html:a> comes along with a\n                              <html:a href=\"#rico:PhysicalLocation\">Physical Location\n                           class</html:a>, and with a <html:a href=\"#rico:Coordinates\">Coordinates\n                              class</html:a>. A Place is considered both a geographical and\n                           historical entity. As a historical entity, among other features, it has a\n                           history, and may be preceded or succeeded by other Places. A Place also\n                           may have zero to many Physical Location through time (for instance, its\n                           boundaries, if it is an administrative area or a country, may change).\n                           Each Physical Location may be connected to zero to many Coordinates. This\n                           model is quite close to the Linked Places Format (<html:a href=\"https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places\">https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places</html:a>).</html:li>\n                        <html:li>Another example of such an addition is the <html:a href=\"#rico:Proxy\">Proxy class</html:a>, that represents (stands for)\n                           a Record Resource as it exists in a specific other Record Resource, and\n                           may therefore be useful when you describe records which are\n                           simultaneously included in several distinct record resources.</html:li>\n                        <html:li>\n                           <html:strong>finally, a system of n-ary classes helps to implement the\n                              Relations section of RiC-CM</html:strong>. While these relations also\n                           are represented as simple, binary object properties (e.g. <html:a href=\"#rico:hasOrganicProvenance\">hasOrganicProvenance</html:a> that\n                           corresponds to RiC-R026 relation), you may need to assign different\n                           attributes to a relation, e.g. a date, certainty or description, as it is\n                           already possible, and quite often done, in a XML/EAC-CPF file. One of the\n                           standard available methods for representing such a documented relation in\n                           RDF for now is to use a class. Thus, for example, in RiC-O a <html:a href=\"#rico:OrganicProvenanceRelation\">OrganicProvenanceRelation\n                              class</html:a> exists. Instances of this class can connect one to many\n                           Agents to one to many created or accumulated Record Resources or\n                           Instantiations, which actually is a quite common situation. In addition\n                           to properties that can be used for any Thing, they may have some specific\n                           object properties, like <html:a href=\"#rico:relationHasDate\">rico:relationHasDate</html:a> that was added in RiC-O 1.1, or <html:a href=\"#rico:relationCertainty\">rico:relationCertainty</html:a>,\n                              <html:a href=\"#rico:relationSource\">rico:relationSource</html:a>,\n                              <html:a href=\"#rico:relationState\">rico:relationState</html:a>).

However, as\n                        already said, in addition to these datatype properties, the Name and\n                        Identifier RiC-CM attributes also have corresponding classes (subclasses of\n                           <html:a href=\"#rico:Appellation\">rico:Appellation</html:a>). A resource\n                        may have several Identifiers (e.g. archival reference code, system number,\n                        digital object identifier) or Names and each comes with different\n                        attributes; in this case instances of classes are needed. The Location\n                        RiC-CM attribute also has a <html:a href=\"#rico:PhysicalLocation\">rico:PhysicalLocation</html:a> corresponding class (for users who want\n                        to use Place, Physical Location and Coordinates for handling\n                        places).</html:p>\n                     <html:p>As already said too, every RiC-CM attribute that has ‘controlled value’\n                        or ‘rule-based’ as a schema value, has a class as corresponding component in\n                        RiC-O. <html:strong>However, for these CM attributes that correspond to a\n                           RiC-O class, as it is necessary to provide an immediately usable\n                           ontology, two supplementary datatype properties exist that allow not to\n                           use the classes, at least for a while, if you want to implement RiC-O and\n                           create RiC-O/RDF datasets from existing archival metadata without being\n                           able to handle URIs for the information you have</html:strong>.</html:p>\n                     <html:p>For example, you may not be able to handle and maintain URIs for some\n                        controlled values you use in EAD finding aids for carrier types: maybe your\n                        information system does not use a vocabulary for this, and you cannot for a\n                        while consider these carrier types as full entities. Nevertheless you want\n                        to produce RiC-O datasets where every piece of information is kept, and you\n                        want to avoid blank nodes. If RiC-O would only provide the Carrier Type\n                        class, it would be an issue for you.</html:p>\n                     <html:p>So RiC-O provides a <html:a href=\"#rico:type\">rico:type</html:a>\n                        datatype property, with range rdfs:literal, which allows you to move\n                        forward. For RiC-CM Coordinates attribute, you also have the <html:a href=\"#rico:geographicalCoordinates\">rico:geographicalCoordinates</html:a> datatype property.</html:p>\n                     <html:p>These datatype properties have a skos:scopeNote which says (for\n                        example) \"Provided for usability reasons.

Thus, there of course is Date\n                        and Rule classes in RiC-O (since there are Date and Rule entities in\n                        RiC-CM). And <html:strong>you also have a <html:a href=\"#rico:date\">rico:date</html:a> datatype property, which has several\n                           subproperties; plus a <html:a href=\"#rico:ruleFollowed\">rico:ruleFollowed</html:a> datatype property</html:strong>. The same\n                        analysis led us to keep the <html:a href=\"#rico:history\">rico:history</html:a> datatype property in RiC-O (same as RiC-CM history\n                        attribute), while RiC-CM and RiC-O also provide the <html:a href=\"#rico:Event\">Event</html:a> class, and using a series of Events may\n                        of course be a better method, easier to query, link and display, than simply\n                        using a history prose discourse. The two methods may be used in parallel\n                        within the same dataset by an institution that, for example, would decide to\n                        emphasize only the accession, appraisal and description events among the\n                        whole history of Record Resources.</html:p>\n                     <html:p>These datatype properties have the same kind of skos:scopeNote as\n                        above.</html:p>\n                     <html:p>Finally, <html:strong>we have introduced a few datatype properties that\n                           do not correspond to any RiC-CM attribute</html:strong>.</html:p>\n                     <html:p>Some are superproperties, and thus group datatype properties: <html:a href=\"#rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent\">rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent</html:a>, with rico:carrierExtent,\n                        rico:instantiationExtent and rico:recordResourceExtent as subproperties;\n                           <html:a href=\"#rico:textualValue\">rico:textualValue</html:a>, with\n                        rico:expressedDate, rico:normalizedValue and rico:quantity as subproperties;\n                           <html:a href=\"#rico:measure\">rico:measure</html:a>; <html:a href=\"#rico:referenceSystem\">rico:referenceSystem</html:a>; <html:a href=\"#rico:note\">rico:note</html:a> (added in RiC-O 1.1), with\n                        rico:authenticityNote, rico:integrityNote and\n                        rico:physicalCharacteristicsNote as subproperties.</html:p>\n                     <html:p>Some are simply more specific properties, like: <html:a href=\"#rico:accrualsStatus\">rico:accrualsStatus</html:a>; <html:a href=\"#rico:recordResourceStructure\">rico:recordResourceStructure</html:a> and <html:a href=\"#rico:instantiationStructure\">rico:instantiationStructure</html:a>,\n                        subproperties of rico:structure; <html:a href=\"#rico:title\">rico:title</html:a> (subproperty of rico:name); <html:a href=\"#rico:altitude\"> >rico:altitude</html:a>, <html:a href=\"#rico:height\">rico:height</html:a>, <html:a href=\"#rico:latitude\">rico:latitude</html:a>, <html:a href=\"#rico:length\">rico:length</html:a>, <html:a href=\"#rico:longitude\">rico:longitude</html:a>, <html:a href=\"#rico:width\">rico:width</html:a>\n                        (subproperties of rico:measure), <html:a href=\"#rico:geodesicSystem\">rico:geodesicSystem</html:a> and <html:a href=\"#rico:altimetricSystem\">rico:altimetricSystem</html:a> (subproperties of rico:referenceSystem);\n                           <html:a href=\"#rico:sentimentOrEmotionExpressed\">rico:sentimentOrEmotionExpressed</html:a> (added in RiC-O 1.1),\n                        subproperty of rico:scopeAndContent.</html:p>\n                  </html:div>\n                  <html:div id=\"about_RiC-O_object-properties\">\n                     <html:h6>3.
